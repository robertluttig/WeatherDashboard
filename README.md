# WeatherDashboard
This App lets a user view current location specific weather conditions
The reason for this app is that if I for example go on a road trip I have the ability to check out the weather for the stops on my trip. I can search for a city and see the current as well as future weather conditions(5 day-forecast). My search history is saved through local storage letting me view what previously  searched for.
The Programms used in this project were a weather API and Bootstrap for the layout.
